  m_dialogue: Detective! That's an outrageous accusation! How would... I would never...
    So you figured it out. No point in trying to deny it any longer. I know when
    I'm beaten. I underestimated you. It's true. I killed the mayor. She was a fool
    who wanted to cut funding for the police force. She said the town was too peaceful.
    That we were needed. But I gave her a reason to keep us around. Good job detective,
    you've solved the  mystery.
